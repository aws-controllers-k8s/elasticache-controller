# "RPNG" means that the field replicasPerNodeGroup is set (instead of nodeGroupConfiguration),
# meaning that this replication group has a uniform configuration across all shards. This is one of the more
# basic configurations as very few fields are specified and the resulting RG can either be CME or CMD
# (depending on the number of specified node groups).
