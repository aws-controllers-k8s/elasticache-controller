              GlobalReplicationGroupSpec defines the desired state of GlobalReplicationGroup.

              Consists of a primary cluster that accepts writes and an associated secondary
              cluster that resides in a different Amazon region. The secondary cluster
              accepts only reads. The primary cluster automatically replicates updates
              to the secondary cluster.

                 * The GlobalReplicationGroupIdSuffix represents the name of the Global
                 datastore, which is what you use to associate a secondary cluster.

                description: |-
                  The suffix name of a Global datastore. Amazon ElastiCache automatically applies
                  a prefix to the Global datastore ID when it is created. Each Amazon Region
                  has its own prefix. For instance, a Global datastore ID created in the US-West-1
                  region will begin with "dsdfu" along with the suffix name you provide. The
                  suffix, combined with the auto-generated prefix, guarantees uniqueness of
                  the Global datastore name across multiple regions.

                  prefixes, see Using the Amazon CLI with Global datastores (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/dg/Redis-Global-Datastores-CLI.html).
